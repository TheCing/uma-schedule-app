## New Race Data Structure

### Enhanced Fields

Each race now includes:

```javascript
{
  id: "satsuki-sho-y2",              // Generated from name + year
  name: "Satsuki Sho",               // Official race name
  year: 2,                            // Training year (1-3)
  month: "April",                     // Month name
  week: "Early",                      // "Early" or "Late"
  fans: 15000,                        // Base fan reward
  distance: "Medium",                 // Category: Short/Mile/Medium/Long
  meters: 2000,                       // Actual race distance in meters
  image: "https://...",               // Race banner image URL
  surface: "Turf",                    // "Turf", "Dirt", or null
  notes: [...]                        // Array of helpful notes from GameTora
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Conversion Script

Created automated conversion from GameTora format:

- ✅ Parsed date strings ("First YearJuly 2" → year: 1, month: "July", week: "Late")
- ✅ Extracted distance in meters from descriptions
- ✅ Categorized distances into Short/Mile/Medium/Long
- ✅ Generated unique IDs from race names
- ✅ Estimated fan rewards based on race grade
- ✅ Extracted surface type (Turf/Dirt)
- ✅ Preserved race notes and details

### 2. Updated Files

- **`src/data/raceData.js`** - Main race data export (backwards compatible)
- **`src/data/races.json`** - JSON format for easy parsing

### 3. Enhanced Results Display

Updated `ResultsDisplay.jsx` to show:

- ✅ Distance category with color-coded badges
- ✅ Race surface (Turf/Dirt) with badges
- ✅ Exact distance in meters
- ✅ Improved table layout

### 4. New Styling (`ResultsDisplay.css`)

Added styled components:

- **Distance Badges:**
  - Short: Red theme
  - Mile: Orange theme
  - Medium: Blue theme
  - Long: Purple theme
- **Surface Badges:**
  - Turf: Green theme
  - Dirt: Brown theme
- Enhanced typography and spacing

## Distance Categorization Logic

```javascript
meters < 1400         → Short
1400 ≤ meters < 1800  → Mile
1800 ≤ meters < 2400  → Medium
meters ≥ 2400         → Long
```

## Fan Reward Estimation

Based on race grade and importance:

- **G1 races:** 30,000 fans
- **G2 races:** 20,000 fans
- **G3 races:** 15,000 fans
- **Open/Listed:** 10,000 fans
- **Maiden/Debut:** 5,000 fans

## Notable Races Included

### Sample G1 Races (30k fans)

- Saudi Arabia Royal Cup (Y1)
- Junior Cup (Y2)
- Queen Cup (Y2)
- Tokyo Yushun (Japan Derby) (Y2)
- Tenno Sho Spring/Autumn (Y2-Y3)
- Japan Cup (Y2-Y3)
- Arima Kinen (Y2-Y3)

### Special Races

- Junior Make Debut (mandatory first race)
- Junior Maiden Races (for non-winners)
- All major stakes races across three years

## Handling of Null Fields

### ID and HREF Fields

The scraped data had `null` values for `id` and `href` fields. Solution:

- **Generated IDs:** Created from race name + year (e.g., "satsuki-sho-y2")
- **HREF:** Not needed for app functionality, omitted from converted data
- Original GameTora href can be reconstructed if needed

## App Compatibility

### Backwards Compatible

The schedule calculator continues to work with:

- All existing distance preference logic
- Fan bonus calculations
- Race filtering by distance category
- 320k fan goal tracking

### Enhanced Features

New information available for future enhancements:

- Race images for visual schedule display
- Surface type for surface-specific strategy
