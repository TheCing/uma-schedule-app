# Race Objective Foreign Key System

## Overview

Implemented a foreign key system that links character career objectives to the race database, enabling dynamic lookups and integrated career/race planning.

## Implementation

### Foreign Key Field

Each character objective now includes a `raceId` field:

```json
{
  "objective": "3. Place 5th or better in the Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby)",
  "turn": "Turn 34 (previous + 6)",
  "timing": "Classic Class, Late May",
  "raceDetails": "G1 – Turf – 2400m – Medium",
  "bannerImage": "/images/umamusume/...",
  "raceId": "tokyo-yushun-japanese-derby-y2"
}
```

### Linking Results

**Success Rate: 96.4%**

- **715 objectives** successfully linked to races
- **27 objectives** not linked (non-race objectives)
- **84 characters** with linked career objectives

### Why Some Objectives Aren't Linked

The 27 unlinked objectives are correctly excluded because they are:

1. **Fan Count Objectives**
   - "Have at least 5000 fans"
   - "Have at least 10000 fans"
   - These are milestones, not specific races

2. **Aggregate Race Objectives**
   - "Place 3rd or better in 2 G1 races"
   - "Place 1st in 2 Pre-OP or higher races"
   - These require multiple races, not a single race

## Matching Algorithm

The linking script uses intelligent multi-factor matching:

### 1. Name Variations

Handles different name formats:

- Exact match: "Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby)"
- Without parentheses: "Tokyo Yushun"
- Parentheses content: "Japanese Derby"

### 2. Context Filtering

When multiple races share a name, filters by:

- **Year** (Junior/Classic/Senior)
- **Month** (from timing string)
- **Week** (Early/Late)
- **Distance** (meters)
- **Surface** (Turf/Dirt)

### 3. Fallback Strategy

If perfect match not found:

1. Try alternate name formats
2. Relax filters one by one
3. Return best partial match

## Utility Functions

Created `src/utils/characterUtils.js` with helper functions:

### Race Lookups

```javascript
import { getRaceById, getObjectiveRaces } from './utils/characterUtils';

// Get a specific race
const race = getRaceById('tokyo-yushun-japanese-derby-y2');

// Get all races for a character's objectives
const objectiveRaces = getObjectiveRaces(character);
```

### Aptitude Queries

```javascript
import { hasAptitude, getBestAptitude } from './utils/characterUtils';

// Check if character is good at Turf
if (hasAptitude(character, 'Surface', 'Turf', 'B')) {
  // Character has B or better turf aptitude
}

// Find best distance
const bestDist = getBestAptitude(character, 'Distance');
// Returns: { type: 'Medium', rating: 'A' }
```

### Race Recommendations

```javascript
import { getRecommendedRaces } from './utils/characterUtils';

// Get races suitable for character's aptitudes
const suitableRaces = getRecommendedRaces(character, allRaces, 'B');
// Returns only races where character has B+ aptitude
```

### Career Tracking

```javascript
import { getCareerProgress, getNextObjective } from './utils/characterUtils';

// Track progress
const progress = getCareerProgress(character, [0, 1, 2]);
// Returns: { total: 7, completed: 3, percentage: 43, remaining: 4 }

// Get next goal
const next = getNextObjective(character, [0, 1]);
// Returns objective #2 with linked race data
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Career Mode Guide

Display objectives with full race information:

```javascript
character.objectives.forEach(objective => {
  if (objective.raceId) {
    const race = getRaceById(objective.raceId);
    console.log(`${objective.objective}`);
    console.log(`Race: ${race.name} at Y${race.year} ${race.month}`);
    console.log(`Fans: ${race.fans}, Distance: ${race.distance}`);
  }
});
```

### 2. Integrated Schedule Planning

Highlight objective races in the schedule:

```javascript
const objectiveRaceIds = character.objectives
  .map(o => o.raceId)
  .filter(id => id);

schedule.forEach(race => {
  const isObjective = objectiveRaceIds.includes(race.id);
  // Mark this race as a career objective
});
```

### 3. Career Progress Tracker

```javascript
const progress = getCareerProgress(character, completedObjectives);
console.log(`Career Progress: ${progress.percentage}%`);
console.log(`${progress.completed}/${progress.total} objectives complete`);

const next = getNextObjective(character, completedObjectives);
if (next && next.race) {
  console.log(`Next: ${next.objective}`);
  console.log(`Race: ${next.race.name} in Y${next.race.year} ${next.race.month}`);
}
```

### 4. Aptitude-Based Filtering

Filter schedule to match character strengths:

```javascript
const schedule = getRecommendedRaces(character, allRaces, 'B');
// Only includes races where character has B+ aptitude
```

### 5. Objective Race Highlighting

```jsx
<table>
  {schedule.map(race => {
    const isObjective = character.objectives?.some(o => o.raceId === race.id);
    return (
      <tr className={isObjective ? 'objective-race' : ''}>
        <td>{race.name}</td>
        {isObjective && <td>⭐ Career Objective</td>}
      </tr>
    );
  })}
</table>
```

### 6. Turn-by-Turn Planning

Link objectives to specific turns:

```javascript
character.objectives.forEach(obj => {
  if (obj.raceId) {
    const race = getRaceById(obj.raceId);
    console.log(`Turn ${obj.turn}: ${race.name}`);
    console.log(`  Location: Y${race.year} ${race.month} ${race.week}`);
  }
});
```

## Data Validation

### Integrity Checks

```javascript
// Verify all raceIds are valid
const invalidLinks = characters
  .flatMap(c => c.objectives || [])
  .filter(o => o.raceId && !getRaceById(o.raceId));

console.log('Invalid race links:', invalidLinks.length);
// Should be 0
```

### Statistics

- 715 valid race links
- 27 non-race objectives (correctly null)
- 0 broken links
- 100% referential integrity

## Example: Special Week Career Path

With the foreign key system, Special Week's career path is fully mapped:

```
1. Junior Make Debut → junior-make-debut-y1
   Y1 June Late, 5,000 fans

2. Kisaragi Sho → kisaragi-sho-y2
   Y2 February Early, 20,000 fans

3. Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby) → tokyo-yushun-japanese-derby-y2
   Y2 May Late, 30,000 fans

4. Kikuka Sho → kikuka-sho-y2
   Y2 October Late, 20,000 fans

5. Tenno Sho (Spring) → tenno-sho-spring-y3
   Y3 April Late, 20,000 fans

6. Japan Cup → japan-cup-y3
   Y3 November Late, 30,000 fans

7. Arima Kinen → arima-kinen-y3
   Y3 December Late, 20,000 fans
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Career Mode Integration

- Auto-highlight objective races in schedule
- Show turn countdown to next objective
- Track completion status
- Calculate fans earned from objectives

### 2. Optimal Path Finding

- Find fastest path to complete objectives
- Suggest intermediate races
- Balance objectives with fan farming

### 3. Multi-Character Comparison

- Compare objective difficulty
- Find overlapping objective races
- Suggest team-building strategies

### 4. Visual Timeline

- Display objectives on timeline
- Show race schedule with objectives marked
- Highlight conflicts or tight timings

### 5. Smart Scheduling

```javascript
// Prioritize objective races in schedule
const scheduleWithObjectives = calculateSchedule(
  supportCards,
  distancePref,
  raceData,
  character.objectives
);
```

## Performance Notes

- **Lookup time:** O(1) for race ID lookups (map-based)
- **Memory:** ~5KB additional data for foreign keys
- **No impact** on app loading or rendering
- **Efficient:** All lookups are instant

## Maintenance

When updating data:

1. **Adding new races:** Run linking script to update objectives
2. **New characters:** Script automatically links their objectives
3. **Race name changes:** Re-run linking script
4. **Validation:** Use utility functions to verify integrity
