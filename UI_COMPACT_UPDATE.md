# UI Compact Layout Update

## Overview

Redesigned the entire app to fit on a single screen without scrolling, making it more efficient and easier to use. All content now fits within the viewport (100vh).

## Layout Structure

```
Container (100vh, flex column, no overflow)
├── H1 (flex-shrink: 0, 0.5rem margin)
└── Card (flex: 1, flex column, overflow hidden)
    ├── H2 (flex-shrink: 0)
    ├── Filters/Info (flex-shrink: 0)
    ├── Main Content (flex: 1, overflow auto)
    │   ├── Character Grid (scrollable)
    │   ├── Support Cards (scrollable)
    │   └── Results Table (scrollable)
    └── Button (flex-shrink: 0)
```

## Benefits

### User Experience

- ✅ **No page scrolling** - entire app visible at once
- ✅ **Faster scanning** - see more characters/races at once
- ✅ **Cleaner UI** - less whitespace, more content
- ✅ **Better focus** - scroll only within relevant sections

### Technical

- ✅ **Responsive** - adapts to different viewport sizes
- ✅ **Performance** - no layout shifts or reflows
- ✅ **Maintainable** - flexbox-based layout is flexible
- ✅ **Consistent** - unified spacing system

## Responsive Behavior

The layout remains functional on different screen sizes:

- Large screens (>1200px): Full card grid visible
- Medium screens (768-1200px): 6-8 cards per row
- Small screens (<768px): 4-5 cards per row, maintains viewport fit

## Scrolling Strategy

Only specific sections scroll, not the whole page:

1. **Character Grid** - scrolls vertically within allocated space
2. **Support Cards** - scrolls vertically if needed
3. **Results Table** - scrolls both directions within container
4. **Filters/Headers** - stay fixed (no scroll)

## Size Comparison

### Before

- Page height: 2000-3000px (with all content)
- Character cards: 140px × 187px
- Total padding/margins: ~100px
- Scrolling: Entire page

### After

- Page height: 100vh (~700-900px typical)
- Character cards: 110px × 147px
- Total padding/margins: ~40px
- Scrolling: Content areas only

## Testing Checklist

- [x] All content fits in viewport at 1920×1080
- [x] Character grid scrolls properly
- [x] Support deck input scrolls when needed
- [x] Results table scrolls horizontally and vertically
- [x] No overflow issues in any step
- [x] Buttons remain visible and accessible
- [x] Text remains readable at smaller sizes
- [x] Touch targets remain adequate (>40px)

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

1. Add zoom controls for character cards
2. Collapsible filter sections for even more space
3. Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
4. Remember scroll positions between steps
5. Add density toggle (comfortable/compact/dense)

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working in:

- Chrome 120+
- Firefox 120+
- Safari 17+
- Edge 120+

Uses standard CSS3 features:

- Flexbox (full support)
- CSS Grid (full support)
- Viewport units (full support)
- Custom scrollbars (WebKit only, graceful degradation)
